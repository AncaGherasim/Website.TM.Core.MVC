      size=2><STRONG>CONFIRMATION AND DEPOSIT POLICY FOR TOUR PACKAGES: 
      </STRONG><BR>Attempt to confirm any reservation will be made only upon 
      receipt of a deposit of $100.00 per person. Services and prices in quotes 
      are not confirmed until the customer has received formal confirmation in 
      the form of an invoice from Beach Destinations. Deposit will be applied to 
      the final payment. If services and prices are confirmed and the client 
      cancels there will be a $25 cancellation fee per person.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000099 
      size=2><STRONG>FINAL PAYMENT FOR TOUR PACKAGES: </STRONG><BR>Generally 
      final payment is due 45 days prior to date of departure. Bookings within 
      45 days of departure are subject to immediate payment following 
      confirmation. All payments for bookings within 30 days of departure must 
      be paid by credit card only.</FONT></P>

      </STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000099 
      size=2><STRONG>Cancellations:</STRONG> If cancellation is received in 
      writing by Beach Destinations at least 30 days prior to departure, a full 
      refund will be made, minus a $50.00 administrative charge per person plus 
      the applicable supplier cancellation fees. For cancellations received 
      within 30 days of departure a 50% cancellation penalty will be imposed. No 
      refunds will be made 7 days prior to departure. Some packages (Carnival, 
      New Year's Eve) are non-refundable. Different cancellation penalties may 
      apply during holiday periods and special events such as Carnivals and 
      festivals. Hotels, airlines or other suppliers may have stricter 
      cancellation penalties than those described above. In those cases, the 
      customer will pay the penalties the suppliers imposes to us. We strongly 
      recommend that you purchase trip cancellation insurance to cover such 
      cancellation fees. Please consult our travel insurance plan. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000099 
      size=2><STRONG>Changes:</STRONG> For a confirmed booking with a departure 
      date longer than 30 days, any change is subject to a fee of $25. Changes 
      within 30 days of departure are charged $100 per booking. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000099 
      size=2><STRONG>AIR FARES: </STRONG><BR>Some airfares included in tour 
      packages require immediate payment and ticketing. All airfares purchased 
      as air only without packages require immediate payment. Some airfares are 
      non-refundable and most lose their complete value after the departure 
      date. Itinerary changes may be permitted for a substantial fee of at least 
      $175. Itinerary change fees depend on airline and destination at the time 
      of purchase. An air ticket is non-transferable and name changes are not 
      permitted. Please ensure the passenger names are exactly as in their 
      passports before you order the tickets. Airfare rules for group 
      reservations have their own Terms and Conditions, which will be sent to 
      you at time of booking.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000099 
      size=2><STRONG>REFUNDS: </STRONG><BR>Any claims for refunds must be made 
      IN WRITING within 30 days of scheduled return. All negotiable vouchers 
      and/or air tickets must accompany the claim. No refunds will be made for 
      features included in our itineraries that travelers chose not to take part 
      in. No refunds will be made for missing transfers or sightseeing tours due 
      to changes or delays in airline schedules. Beach Destinations will not 
      refund any money for changes in travel arrangements made by the traveler 
      after the departure date. Any service issue affecting the quality of the 
      guest's hotel stay must be addressed directly with the hotel's management 
      at the time the issue arises since refunds cannot be given for such 
      inconveniences. No guarantees or warranties, express or implied, are made 
      that the tour package will meet all of the traveler's 
      expectations.</FONT></P>
