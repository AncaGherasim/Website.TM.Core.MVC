<strong style="font-size:16px">Changes in TSA Rules</strong><br /><br />
<strong>New Rules for Airline Bookings</strong><br />
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been working for some time with the airlines
and the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) to implement new Secure Flight rules. Secure
Flight is a TSA program to improve security screening and help reduce the number of false positive
matches to the terrorist watch list.<br /><br />

<strong>Full Name</strong><br />
Beginning May 15, 2009, all airline bookings must contain the full name of the passenger as
it appears on the identification (driver’s license and/or passport) that will be used at airport
security.<br />
Ex: The passenger’s ID shows Anna Marie Boots (Marie is the middle name).<br />
The reservation must show Anna Marie Boots<br />
Anna Boots and Anna M Boots will no longer be accepted.<br />
Ex: The passenger’s name is John Frederick Smith.<br />
However, the ID shows John F. Smith (F is a middle initial).<br />
The reservation must show John F Smith.<br />
John Smith and John Frederick Smith will not be accepted.<br />
If the name does not match the ID you may at the least experience longer than usual delays at
airport security, or at worst denied boarding.<br /><br />
<a name="redress"></a><strong>Redress Number</strong><br />
Reservations must also include the passenger’s Redress Number, if one has been issued. A
Redress Number is a TSA-issued code given to certain passengers whose names have
triggered false positive matches to watch lists in the past. A Redress Number is optional,
however if you have a number it must be added to the record. Applying for a redress number
is the passenger’s responsibility. More information on the Redress program can be found at

All domestic US reservations must include the full name (as used on the ID to be presented at
the airport), date of birth, gender, and optional Redress Number.<br /><br />

All international reservations must include the full name (as used on the ID to be presented at
the airport), date of birth, gender, and optional Redress Number.
This is in addition to any requirements individual airlines and countries may have, which may
include your passport number, date of expiration, country of citizenship, and visa
information.
